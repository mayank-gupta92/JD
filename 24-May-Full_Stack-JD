The Role
Mercle Network is all about a data layer that aggregates identity and reputation information for Internet . The focus is on user control and privacy: individuals can manage their data in their own vaults(private or public), choosing what to share or keep private.

Attestations work as the building blocks for storing information about any users; We have categories this data into two parts: Public data (attestations which can be stored publicly) and Private Data (Sensitive data information about the user). The public data attestations are stored on the decentralized IPFS network, while private sensitive data can be stored on a private database or on the user's device locally, which can be later shareable through zero-knowledge proofs. This approach allows any entity on the internet to issue attestation to other users relative to them. to issue to solve real-world problems for Dapps, DAOs, and various online platforms by offering reliable, authenticated data.
